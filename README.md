# About Me API
A real-ish backend project for practice and teaching of Rails APIs

## Purposes
This is not a project with any defined special purpose. It doesn't support any production frontend (yet). Instead this is meant to be a go-to safe place to try new rails features, teach through example, try out dependencies, etc. But for the sake of categorization and a halfway decent Readme, I will list out the main drivers for putting this together.

### Teaching (myself and others)
The main reason for this project is to serve as sandbox for rails development and thusly, a way to dive deeper on rails without having to setup a new project everytime.

### Guilt-free Testing
I want a rails app I can put through the spin cycle and not worry about breaking something upon which people are actually depending. At the same time I want that experimentation to take place in an established system, a maintained Rails App with most if not all of the bells and whistles a standing longterm project would have.

### Best Practices Enforcement
Being a full-time developer on closed-source code means that I don't have as much time to devote to open-source projects. I'd like this repo to serve as a way to reinforce best practices across the entire development cycle, from IRB to CI-CD.
